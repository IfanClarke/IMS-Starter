# Project Title
IMS 

This is an Inventory Management System so businesses can create items, orders and customers.
You are able to create, read, update and delete customers, items and orders.

## Getting Started
 Open a command line. Navigate into the IMS-Starter folder and then the target folder and write java -jar ims-0.0.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar to open the file.

### Prerequisites


SQL and Java are needed. JUnit and Mockito to run the tests.



### Installing

Download the folder. Run "MVN Package" to allow it to work on a command line - then follow the above under "Getting Started".



### Unit Tests 

Unit tests test small parts of the source code at once. In this case all the constructors, crud functionality and integration with SQL are tested.

### Integration Tests 
Integration tests test bigger parts of the code than unit tests.
